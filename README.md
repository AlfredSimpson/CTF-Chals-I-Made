# CTF-Chals-I-Made
How to make them and how to break them

You probably are here because I created a challenge that you went up against and you're not really sure why I hate you (I don't) or how to solve it. Or, worse, you've opened 10 tickets during the event telling me they're guessy because you couldn't figure out the right tactics and wanted to be mean but then thought "well, maybe...". I promise you, I'm not offended. I want to help.

# About the Repo

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of CTF challenges that I have created, with a focus on OSINT, cryptography, and digital forensics. I have designed these challenges to test and enhance your skills in these areas, while also providing a fun and engaging way to learn and practice cybersecurity concepts.

In this repository, you will find a variety of challenges, ranging from easy to difficult, that cover a wide range of OSINT, cryptography, and digital forensics topics. Each challenge is accompanied by a set of instructions, hints, and solutions, so you can test your skills and learn at your own pace.

I hope that you find these challenges helpful and enjoyable, and that they inspire you to dive deeper into the fascinating world of cybersecurity. Let's learn, grow, and compete together!

# What You'll find

I realized quickly that there aren't a lot of resources dedicated to understanding HOW a CTF is created, what goes into the challenge making, or how to protect it from the hazards of a cybersecurity event. So I'll cover how I make the problems, how I've organized the events, and how you could do similar. 


## If you're a student...

And you want to start a cybersecurity club but you're not sure how, let's get in touch. I founded NJIT's first cybersecurity club and would love to help you do the same. Let's make a better tomorrow.

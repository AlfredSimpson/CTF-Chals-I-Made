# JerseyCTF 2023

JerseyCTF 2023 was hosted by NJIT's ACM, SCI, and NICC. This event took place April 15th to April 16th and contained well over 55 challenges.


## What I did

As President of NICC, I helped coordinate the event with the student leads of ACM and SCI, along with the college. Creatively I helped to develop the storyline, an event focused on rogue AI, time travel, and mishaps. In addition, I was responsible for the creation of over 1/5 of the deployed challenges.

## What made the cut



## What didn't (yet)

I put 60+ hours into developing one project that, unfortunately, did not make the cut. While it worked on local, it did **not** work when pushed to prod. I believe it was ultimately an issue with the server that we were pushing out to. The program generally worked, except it was largely unable to produce the flag as desired due to an unforseen issue. More information is witheld as I do intend to create and release this project for future events.

Another challenge, a trivia game with a twist that was built in C, was... a nightmare to compile on Docker. To be honest, as of April 2023, I'm just not docker-savvy. I'm learning, and hope to deploy this in the future. This was a binary problem that had multiple routes to solve.


# Stats of the event

The event, which contained challenges submitted by many different members, contained bin, crypto, forensics, misc, osint, web, and "Spooky" challenges. Spooky were 3 relatively simple challenges we released from NICC's first attempt at a CTF that was only held internally. These challenges were simple and just meant to encourage participation within the organization.

# A Quick explanation of the challenge's creation


One-mo'-dance-for-mary was one of the only unsolved challenges at JerseyCTF, but I promise you, it wasn't that hard. Go see the Breakdown for why...

## What went into making the challenge

Making a GOOD osint challenge has multiple paths you can take to find the answer. It shouldn't rely on one exact search, but rather multiple interpretations to find the right result. It should also help you explore a thing you probably weren't aware of before.

In the case of one mo' dance for mary, I wanted to continue the storyline of Mary Morse (introduced in SpringForwardCTF). In order to do this, I would need to find a Mary Morse online in a way that was not only easily found, but could be narrowed down to the point that you'd get the exact answer.

I knew I wanted to use a newspaper, so I began looking in the New York Times. I then realized that people would need to pay for this, so I decided against it. Again, this should be accessible and found in multiple ways. So I did what someone should do to start after they gathered the data:

Search for a newspaper archive collection.

Thankfully I found the Library of Congress's archive.

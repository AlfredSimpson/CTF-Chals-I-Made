If we're going to fix this A.I. from destroying everything, we're going to need help.

Grace Hopper could've helped, but this time machine is on the fritz!

Instead of landing at Vassar in 1924 we're 45 seconds from Broadway and 90 years too late.

Guess that's what we get for trusting A.I. to help us make this. 

At least they've got a good corned beef sandwich while I wait for backup to arrive.

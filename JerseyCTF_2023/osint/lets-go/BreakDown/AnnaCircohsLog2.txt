Status update - The supplies we got helped me make a few more adjustments.
Unfortunately, it only took me 40 more years backwards, and still not near Grace Hopper.

Fortunately, if my memory is correct, I can basically get a private concert with my favorite quartet.

Last time I was here was 9 months ago local space-time, before all of the programs began acting up! I wonder if they paved over what HK and I drew in the concrete when they opened up?
